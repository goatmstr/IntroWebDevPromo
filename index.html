      The New York Knicks are a basketball team in the NBA with a very long
      history, being one of the first professional basketball teams ever. It's
      home arena is the iconic Madison Square Garden. Although the team has had
      its ups and downs in recent years, its fans are among the most dedicated
      and loyal fans in the NBA. The Knicks have been playing especially well
      recently thanks to the efforts of Jalen Brunson who was selected as an All
      Star for the first time. Be sure to support the Knicks by going to some
      home games at the garden!
